## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [LessCSS](https://lesscss.org/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

Learned how to use LessCSS and what the pros/cons are of it. Also practised using flexbox/grid.

### Continued development

Probably going to consider continuing to use LessCSS or trying to learn Stylus, as well as working with a more mobile-first approach as I'm not entirely used to working in mobile-first yet. Although I enjoy using TailwindCSS quite a lot because it speeds up development, it's always good to consider more than one approach depending on what the needs of the project/client are.
